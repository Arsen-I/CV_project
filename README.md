A project to interact with food waste in canteens using computer vision.

What is the problem?

Every day, tons of food is left untouched and thrown away. This not only wastes products, but also wastes the resources spent on their production, as well as increasing disposal costs.

How did we solve this?

We have developed a computer solution system that will scan food trays at the end of a meal to:

- Recognize and identify all products under your nose.
- Measure the quantity of each product.
- Comparing before and after pictures of a meal to see how much food was eaten and how much was left.

How it works?

The system will use machine learning algorithms to:

- Find all the products on the images of the trays.
- Classify them into categories (for example, meat, vegetables, side dishes).
- Select each product and count the number of pixels to determine its quantity.
- Comparing before and after images to calculate how much food is left.

What's the use?

Reduce food waste: The system helps the table optimize the quantity of food purchased and portions to minimize waste.
Save money: Reducing waste results in lower food and disposal costs.
Increased awareness: The system can track people's eating habits, helping them realize how much food they waste.
